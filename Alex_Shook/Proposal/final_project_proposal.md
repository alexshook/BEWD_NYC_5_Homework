## BEWD Final Project Proposal

#### (doesn't have a name yet) by Alexandra Shook

For my final project, I want to create an untourist guide to New York City. I'd like it to be a resource for people who want to experiece New York like a local. 

I'm thinking of using the Yelp API to include information on restaurants, museums, stores and other tourist attractions that are not too touristy. In addition to Yelp ratings, I might make something that lets users star attractions (sort of like an upvote/downvote system) and leave their own feedback, too. There's a Yelp gem I can use that looks like it has okay documentation. 

It'll have accounts, security, etc. and cover all of the core requirements for the assignment. If it's allowed, I'd like it to be by invitation only (branding purposes).

As for associations, I thought I'd tie the users to their recommendations and also let users connect to each other somehow-- is that within the realm of possibilities at this skill level?

I don't have any wireframes yet. Just thought of this last night and it's a better idea than my other one (photo sharing, boring).
