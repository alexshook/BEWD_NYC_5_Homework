## BEWD Final Project Proposal

### Retourist

#### An app for visitors who have already done the tourist thing. 

For my final project, I want to create an untourist guide to New York City. I'd like it to be a resource for people who have already been here, gone to all of the popular tourist attractions, and are looking to experiece New York differently. 

I'm thinking of using the Yelp API to include information on restaurants, museums, stores and other tourist attractions that are not too touristy. In addition to Yelp ratings, I might make something that lets users star attractions (sort of like an upvote/downvote system) and leave their own feedback, too. There's a Yelp gem I can use that looks like it has okay documentation and is updated fairly frequently.

It'll have accounts, security, etc. and cover all of the core requirements for the assignment. If it's allowed, I'd like it to be by invitation only (branding purposes).

As for associations, I thought I'd tie the users to their recommendations and also let users connect to each other somehow-- is that within the realm of possibilities at this skill level?

I don't have any wireframes yet. I'm really terrible at design but I promise to try to make something that looks decent.
